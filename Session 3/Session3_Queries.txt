1) Write an SQL query to generate a daily report of the total revenue for a specific date.
	
	-- Replace '2025-11-16' with your desired date

	SELECT 
		DATE(order_date) AS order_day,
		SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
	FROM orders
	WHERE DATE(order_date) = '2025-11-16'
	GROUP BY DATE(order_date);

2)Write an SQL query to generate a monthly report of the top-selling products in a given month.
		
	-- Replace '2025-11' with your target month
	
	SELECT 
		p.product_id,
		p.name,
		SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
	FROM order_details od
	JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
	JOIN orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
	WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) = DATE '2025-11'
	GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name
	ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
	LIMIT 10;

3) Write a SQL query to retrieve a list of customers who have placed orders totaling more than $500 in the past month. Include customer names and their total order amounts.
	
	SELECT
		c.customer_id
		c.first_name,
		c.last_name
		SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
	FROM customers c
	JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 month' AND o.order_date < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
	GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
	HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 500
	ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
